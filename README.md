Group Project for COP 4710

# COP 4710 Project
Exhibition Center Event Website
*(Fall 2020)*

# Problem:
An Exhibition center in the city hosts various events throughout the year, at multiple locations. These events are of different types: social, fundraising, tech talks, arts and craft etc. At the moment, each person who wishes to attend an event has to create a unique login on every different event host’s website, in order to add each event to his/her calendar. The Exhibition center’s management wants a website that would present all the different events on its own main website, which would facilitate different event managers/hosts to present their details on it, and event attendees to sign-up for these events.

# Project Description:
You are asked to implement a web application that solves the aforementioned problems. Any person may register with this application to obtain a user ID and a password. Your web application should be in the form of an online service where every registered person on your online service becomes a user.

## There are three user levels:
* SuperAdmin: This is your team who offers this online service.
* Admin: This is a registered user who wishes to host an event and would like to list the event with your online service.
* Participant: This is a registered user who come to your website to look up information about the
different events.

## A separate user interface is provided for each of the above three categories of users:
1) SuperAdmin Interface: A SuperAdmin can query the event database for the following
information:
* Look up the information about events organized by a particular Admin
* List the events (the event titles) a particular user has participated
2) Admin Interface: Any user may follow the following steps to create an event with your online
service.
* Step 1: Create a website for the event independent of this online service
* Step 2: Provide the following event-related information to your online service
  * Event title
  * Event description
  * The URL of the event homepage created in Step 1
  * Event start date
  * Event end date
  * Event address
* Step 3: Approve the event for listing with your online service
An Admin can list the title and the URL of all the events he/she has organized. He/She can also list only his/her currently active events.
3) Participant Interface: A user can use your online service to look up interesting events to participate. The following search is supported through this interface:
* List the event titles and their URL based on an event start date and an event end date. Any event falls within this time period is displayed.
* List the event titles and their URL for currently active events in a particular city

# Technical Requirements:
* Your implementation should follow the database design process: business operations/constraints, ER-model, the relational model, normalization, implementation etc.
* You need to come-up with relational tables and sample data that are required for the project implementation.
* Your database application must have a browser-based interface. Nice user interface is encouraged but not required.
* Programming languages that you can use for the project: HTML, CSS, JDBC, Java, Javascript, PHP. DBMS’s: Oracle, SQL Server, and MySQL. Before using the tools that are not discussed in the class, please check with the GTA’s.

# Extra Credits: 
The design as described above is intentionally simplified to leave room for innovations. Individual students may add creative features to make it more user friendly. For example, the additional features can be social network integration, calendar, google maps location etc. These are just examples to give you an idea, but you can come-up with your own additional features.

# Grading Policy:
Group Presentation and Demo 70%
Group Project Report 10%
Participation 20%
Extra Credit 30%
* Group Presentation and Demo: There would be two Zoom sessions, 1 held by each TA. Each team has 10 minutes to demo the software. You need to use your own laptop and may host the servers on the same computer. Each team member demonstrates the functionality he/she implemented. Everyone is expected to take part in the demo.
* Group Project Report: This project report provides the ER diagram to explain the database design and discuss how your software is implemented using the development environments selected for your project. Each group member should upload the same report on the assignments section that will be created on webcourses.
* Participation: This is an individual score based on your performance at the demo presentation and your cooperation with other group members in completing the project. Each student in the group will review their peers about their engagement in the Project. Based on the majority vote, we would be deciding whether a student has really participated in the  project or not. A student may want to make up for a low participation score by earning the extra credits discussed below.
* Extra Credits: This is a score for an individual effort on improving the team product. Student who wants to earn extra credits needs to extend the software developed by the team to add additional features.

# Important Dates:
* The presentation date is Dec 9th, 2020, 4 PM to 6:50 PM.
* The project is due on Dec 9th, 2020, at 11:59 PM.
